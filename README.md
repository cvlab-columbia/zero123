## Updates
### we've optimized our code base with some simple tricks and the current demo runs at around 22GB VRAM so it's runnable on a RTX 3090(Ti)!
### weights also available at
```
wget https://cv.cs.columbia.edu/zero123/assets/105000.ckpt
wget https://cv.cs.columbia.edu/zero123/assets/165000.ckpt
```

and huggingface repo (still uploading):
```
https://huggingface.co/datasets/cvlab/zero123-weights 
```
Note that we have released two model weights. By default, we use 105000.ckpt whih is the checkpoint after finetuning 105000 iterations on objaverse. 165000.ckpt is also available.

##  Usage
###  Novel View Synthesis
```
conda create -n zero123 python=3.9
conda activate zero123
cd zero123
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers.git
pip install -e taming-transformers/
git clone https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
pip install -e CLIP/
```

Download checkpoint under `zero123`:

```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1geG1IO15nWffJXsmQ_6VLih7ryNivzVs?usp=sharing
```

Run our gradio demo for novel view synthesis:

```
python gradio_new.py
```

Note that this app uses around 22 GB of VRAM, so it may not be possible to run it on any GPU.

### 3D Reconstruction
Note that we haven't extensively tuned the hyperparameters for 3D reconstruction. Feel free to explore and play around!
```
cd 3drec
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_zero123.py \
    --scene 'pikachu' \
    --index 0 \
    --n_steps 10000 \
    --lr 0.05 \
    --sd.scale 100.0 \
    --emptiness_weight 0 \
    --depth_smooth_weight 10000. \
    --near_view_weight 10000. \
    --train_view True \
    --prefix 'experiments/exp_wild' \
    --vox.blend_bg_texture False \
    --nerf_path 'data/nerf_wild'
```
We tested the installation processes on a system with Ubuntu 20.04 with an NVIDIA GPU with Ampere architecture.
